Using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, a NIDS can be developed and evaluated by training classifier models on it to predict future attacks. However, the development of an effective NIDS is challenging as the network traffic dataset is noisy, imbalanced, and has complex relations, especially for predicting the attack category.
